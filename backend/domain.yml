  utter_intro_session1_4:

  utter_explain_user_state_2:
  - text: "Your state is basically a collection of variables that determine how much steps you are likely able to take today."
  utter_explain_user_state_3:
  - text: "So using that, I will adjust the initially created step goal to make it even more suitable for you!"
  utter_explain_user_state_4:
